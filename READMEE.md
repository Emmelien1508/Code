Companies that provide sharing services for e-scooters are on the rise and can be found in a great number of cities, including Amsterdam. These companies usually provide their services via an app that customers use to reserve an e-scooter and take it for a ride. After riding, the customer can park the e-scooter anywhere within the designated areas.

These e-scooters can be parked anywhere because they are not restricted to a charging station. At the end of the day, each e-scooter sharing company must drive to their empty scooters and replace the empty batteries with full ones. The company must take into account the fact that not every scooter will require charging; thus, it is assumed that they only provide a subset of their scooters with a full battery. Each day, a different subset of scooters needs charging, and the route traveled to replenish batteries must be optimized. Since re-optimizing over and over again might be inconvenient or impossible, determining the optimal route that visits each e-scooter requiring a fresh battery is therefore imperative for these types of companies in order for them to minimize their costs and maximize efficiency. That being said, the goal is to find one single tour that covers all e-scooter locations.

This optimization problem will be solved using five algorithms: Random, Nearest Neighbor, Ant Colony Optimization, 2-Opt and Simulated Annealing.
